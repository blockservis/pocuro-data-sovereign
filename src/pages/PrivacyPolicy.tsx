            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              At Pocuro, privacy isn't just a featureâ€”it's our core principle. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our services. Unlike most applications, Pocuro is designed with a local-first, privacy-preserving architecture where your personal data remains on your device by default.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>
            <p>
              When you create an account, we collect minimal information necessary for account creation, such as email address and a securely hashed version of your password. We do not require personal details like your real name or location.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
            <p>
              By design, Pocuro does not collect or have access to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The content of your documents, financial records, or other personal data you manage within the application</li>
              <li>Your encryption keys, which remain solely on your device</li>
              <li>Your browsing activity or usage patterns within the application</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Technical Information</h3>
            <p>
              We collect limited technical information required to provide our services, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Device information (operating system, device type) to optimize application performance</li>
              <li>Crash reports and error logs (with personal identifiers removed) to improve stability</li>
              <li>Anonymous usage statistics to help us improve our services</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the limited information we collect to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide, maintain, and improve Pocuro services</li>
              <li>Process transactions and manage your account</li>
              <li>Send you important service announcements and updates</li>
              <li>Respond to your requests and support needs</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>How We Store and Protect Your Information</h2>
            <p>
              Your personal data within Pocuro is primarily stored on your device, not our servers. For the limited account information we do store:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>We use industry-standard encryption and security measures</li>
              <li>We regularly review and update our security practices</li>
              <li>We limit access to personal information to authorized personnel only</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Optional Cloud Backup and Synchronization</h2>
            <p>
              Pocuro offers optional encrypted cloud backup and synchronization. If you choose to enable these features:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Your data is encrypted on your device before being transmitted to our servers</li>
              <li>We store only encrypted data that we cannot access or decrypt</li>
              <li>You maintain full control over your encryption keys and can revoke access at any time</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
            <p>You have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Access, correct, or delete your account information</li>
              <li>Export your data in standard formats</li>
              <li>Opt out of non-essential communications</li>
              <li>Choose which features to use, including optional cloud services</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>
              We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of any significant changes and obtain consent where required by law.
            </p>

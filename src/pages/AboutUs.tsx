            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
              At Pocuro, we believe that privacy should be a fundamental right, not a luxury. Our mission is to empower individuals with full control over their personal data while providing powerful tools for organization, productivity, and insight.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Why We Built Pocuro</h2>
            <p>
              In today's digital landscape, our personal information has become a commodity to be bought, sold, and exploited. Most productivity and planning tools require sending your sensitive data to cloud servers, where it can be vulnerable to breaches, subject to surveillance, or used for purposes you never consented to.
            </p>
            <p>
              We built Pocuro to challenge the assumption that you must sacrifice privacy for functionality. By leveraging advanced local processing and privacy-preserving technologies, we've created a platform that keeps your data on your device while still offering the intelligent features you expect from modern applications.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Our Team</h2>
            <p>
              Pocuro was founded by a team of privacy advocates, security engineers, and design thinkers who shared a vision of technology that serves people without exploiting them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our diverse team brings together expertise from cryptography, artificial intelligence, user experience design, and personal productivity. United by a commitment to ethical technology, we're working to create tools that respect human autonomy and dignity.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Our Values</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Privacy-first technology should be available to everyone, not just technical experts.
